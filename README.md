<p>The process begins with the code initializing the webcam by requesting access from the system. The system then connects to and sets up the webcam hardware. Once the webcam is ready, it captures a live image, which the system provides to the code. The code processes this image to detect objects, such as license plates, using computational resources provided by the system. If a license plate is detected, the code crops the relevant part of the image and instructs the system to save this cropped image to an external storage location, such as a disk. Simultaneously, the code logs details about the detection, including timestamps and file paths, which are also stored in the external storage. The processed image, with visual annotations, is then displayed on the monitor, managed by the system. Throughout this process, the code listens for user input, allowing the user to control the program, such as by exiting. Finally, the code ensures that all resources, including the webcam and log files, are properly closed and released by the system before terminating the program. This seamless interaction between the code, system, webcam, and external storage ensures a smooth workflow from image capture to final storage and display. </p>
